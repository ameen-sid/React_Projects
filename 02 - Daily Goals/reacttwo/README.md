# 📝 My Simple To-Do List Application

## 📄 **Description**

This is a simple, single-page to-do list application built with **React**. The app allows users to add, manage, and delete tasks. The to-do tasks are stored locally in the browser's `localStorage` to ensure they persist even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.

## ✨ **Features**

-   **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks to your list.
-   **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are automatically saved to `localStorage`, so you won't lose your list.
-   **Delete Tasks**: Easily remove completed or unwanted tasks.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

-   **React.js**: The core library for building the user interface.
-   **JavaScript (JSX)**: The programming language for application logic.
-   **CSS**: For styling the application's layout and components.
