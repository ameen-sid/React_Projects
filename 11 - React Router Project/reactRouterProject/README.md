# 🛣️ React Router Project: A Single-Page App

## 📄 **Description**

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates the power of **React Router** to create a seamless **Single-Page Application (SPA)** experience. The app features multiple pages (Home, Login, Sign Up, Dashboard) and uses client-side routing to navigate between them without reloading the entire page. It's an excellent example of how to manage routing, create private routes, and build a clean, modern user experience.

## ✨ **Features**

-   **Client-Side Routing**: Navigates between pages without full page reloads, providing a fast and smooth user experience.
-   **Private Routes**: A protected dashboard route that is only accessible to authenticated users, demonstrating route protection.
-   **Modular Components**: The application is structured with reusable components for forms (`LoginForm`, `SignUpForm`) and layout (`Navbar`, `Template`).
-   **Authentication Flow**: Simulates a basic login and signup process.

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

-   **React.js**: The core library for building the user interface.
-   **React Router**: The standard library for routing in React applications.
-   **Vite**: The build tool for a fast and efficient development experience.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
-   **JavaScript (JSX)**: The programming language for application logic.
