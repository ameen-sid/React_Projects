# 🎨 BG Changer: A React Color Picker App

This is a simple web application that demonstrates **state management with multiple states** in React. The app features a set of buttons, each corresponding to a different color. When a user clicks a button, the entire page background color changes to that color, providing a direct and intuitive example of how to manage and update a component's state based on user interaction.
